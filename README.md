# My Speccy

Yet another ZX Spectrum emulator.

I have started this project
for my personal entertainment and education. It's still
in a very early stage. There's no CPU emulation yet.

## Status

* Video works, but it looks like there's a minor bug in the shader.
* Keyboard works.
* Sound output is available, but it's not connected to IO yet.
* CPU 5% done.

## Prerequisites

If you need to run unit tests, you will need to install
`googletest` from [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```sh
brew update
brew install googletest
```

## Installation

Just load it in Xcode and run.

## Release History

* 0.0.1
    * Work in progress
