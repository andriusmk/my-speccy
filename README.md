# My Speccy

Yet another ZX Spectrum emulator.

I have started this project
for my personal entertainment and education. It's still
in a very early stage. There's no CPU emulation yet.

## Status

* Video works.
* Keyboard works.
* Sound output is available, but it's not connected to IO yet.
* CPU 5% done.
* The first milestone is planned on September 30, 2025.

## Teaser

It's my older emulator that uses a third-party Z80 emulation library
that I can't distribute. And it's incomplete. Fortunately it's sufficient
to run Bomb Jack.

## Prerequisites

* MacOS with Xcode installed;
* If you need to run unit tests, you will need to install
`googletest` from [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```sh
brew update
brew install googletest
```

## Installation

Just load it in Xcode and run. Just be warned that you'll not see anything interesting
because the "brain" is still missing.

## Release History
